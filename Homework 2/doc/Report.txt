Without having to look up the PC Structure Learning algorithm, examine and then explain why structure discovery algorithms
MIGHT be able to orient the direction of some edges, but not others.

Structure discovery algorithms often rely on conditional independence tests to determine the presence
or absence of edges between nodes. If two variables are conditionally independent given a third variable,
the algorithm can sometimes orient those edges but not always. E.g., in a chain A -> H -> I, A and I are
dependent, they just become independent once you know H.



Using the pgmpy query example, determine the answers to the queries specified in the instructions.

If Facebook charges you $2 per-person to learn their stance on Gun control, if available, is
the juice worth the squeeze?

Yes. This would be an increadibly good deal since the VPI of learning thier stance on gun
control tells us that info is worth more thatn $20

If you *knew* someone to be in support of Gun Control (ùê∫=1), and Google is offering $0.25
per person to tell you their political affiliation, is the juice worth the squeeze?

No. There is no value to laerning someones political affiliation once we know they support
gun control: VPI(P | G=1) = 0

Finally (scratching some flag requirement for this course, probably): In a small paragraph,
argue for whether or not you believe this practice should be considered ethical, especially
if each individual's characteristics were collected via social media. Compare this practice
to targeted political advertising wherein ads are curated based on perceived in-group.

I do not believe this practice is ethical. A company using technology to target indeviduals
vulnerable to thier advertisments either to sell some product or influence thier decisions
inharently takes advantage of that person. I don't mean that all advertisements are 
unethical, the purpose of advertising is to alert people to the existance of something, it's
only when those advertisements are targeted and used to manipulate people, especially people
who have been determined to be vulnerable to such ads, that it becomes unethical. If these
algorithms were used to determine people who wouod benefit from owning a defendotron instead 
of those likely to spend the most money on one, it would be far more ethical.
